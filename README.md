content of the foods they consume various dietary choices to promote overall health and
well-being.
- Diverse milk options: Wide range of milk options are available such as whole milk, skim milk,
almond milk, soy milk, etc. but consumers often face difficulties in comparing their nutritions.
- Cereal variations: Variety of cereals available, but consumers are often overwhelmed when trying to
